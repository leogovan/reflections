When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

If I wanted to share my work publicly, if I am working with distributed contributors, or if I use more than one workstation to work from. Gives me the power to not be constrained by a single physical device.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Automatic pulls will reduce control, while also potentially causing the pull of unwanted or incomplete features.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Cloning is taking a copy of a repository onto my local machine. A branch is a divergence of the master repository code for working on new features or bugs. A fork is a github-only concept that is effectively the same as cloning but with some additional features such as referencing back to the originator. As mentioned branching is best used to keep the local master clean until the time is ready to merge - it allows traceability through the commit log to show at which point the divergence took place.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
